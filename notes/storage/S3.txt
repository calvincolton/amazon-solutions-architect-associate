Notes
  - S3 IS object-based storage. It is a simply key-value store
    - The key is simply the name of the object
    - The value is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes
    - The Version ID (covered later)
    - The Metadata is data about what you are storing
  - Subresources
    - Access Control Lists
    - Torrent (beyond scope of this course and will not be covered)
  - The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.
  - Files are stored in Buckets (like a folder in the cloud, but with a universal name-space, generating a DNS).
  - URLs for buckets have the following structure:
    https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru or...
    https://s3-region.amazonaws.com/bucket-name
  - When you upload a file to S3, you will receive a HTTP 200 code if uploaded successfully

Data Consistency Model for S3
  - Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
  - Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETE (can take some time to propogate)
