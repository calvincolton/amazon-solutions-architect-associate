Elastic Block Storage
- If EC2 is a virtual server in the cloud, EBS is a virtual disk
- Amazon EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances.
- Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device.
- Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.
- Volumes
  - General Purpose SSD (GP2)
    - general purpose, balances both price and performance
    - Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS and the ability to bust up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes at 3334 GiB and above
  - Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
    - Designed for I/O insensitive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases
    - Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
  - Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
    - Big data
    - Data warehouse
    - Log processing
    - Cannot be a boot volume
  - Cold HDD (SC1)
    - Lowest cost storage for infrequently accessed workloads
    - File server
    - Cannot be a boot volume
  - Magnetic (Standard)
    - Lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume types that is bootable.
    - Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important.
