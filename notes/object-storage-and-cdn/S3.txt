Simple Storage Service (S3)
  - S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage.
  - In essence, it allows you to upload files.
  - Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

Data Consistency Model for S3
  - Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
  - Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETE (can take some time to propogate)

Basics
  - S3 IS object-based storage. It is a simply key-value store
    - The key is simply the name of the object
    - The value is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes
    - The Version ID (covered later)
    - The Metadata is data about what you are storing
  - Subresources
    - Access Control Lists
    - Torrent (beyond scope of this course and will not be covered)
  - Built for 99.99% availability, Amazon guarantess 99.9% availability
  - Amazon guarantess 99.999999999% (11-9s) durability for S3 information
  - Tiered storage is available
    - S3 Standard (no retrieval fee)
    - S3-IA (Infrequently Accessed)
    - S3 One Zone - IA
    - Glacier
      - Very cheap, but used for archival only
      - Versions: Expedited, Standard, or Bulk
      - When you don't care about retrieval times
  - Lifecycle Management
  - Versioning
  - Encryption
  - Secure data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies

Notes
  - The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.
  - Files are stored in Buckets (like a folder in the cloud, but with a universal name-space, generating a DNS).
  - URLs for buckets have the following structure:
    https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru or...
    https://s3-region.amazonaws.com/bucket-name
  - When you upload a file to S3, you will receive a HTTP 200 code if uploaded successfully
  - S3 buckets are managed globally
  - Individual objects do not inherit the bucket's tags
  - Minimum object size is 0 bytes

Charges
  - Storage
  - Requests
  - Storage Management Pricing (charge for tags/metadata)
  - Data Transfer Pricing
  - Transfer Acceleration
    - Enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances your end-users and an S3 bucket
    - Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's global distributed edge locations.
    - As Data arrives on an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over and optimized network path
