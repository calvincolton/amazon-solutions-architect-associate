General Notes on Security
- By default, all newly created buckets are PRIVATE
- You can setup access control to your buckets using:
  - Bucket policies
  - Access Control Lists
- S3 Buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket. This can be done to another bucket.

Encryption
- In Transit
  - from PC to bucket, via SSL/TLS using HTTPS
- At Rest (four types)
  - Server-side encryption methods:
    - S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3
    - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS
    - Server-side encryption with customer provided keys - SSE-C
  - Client-side encryption methods:
    - you encrypt the data on the client-side and then upload it to S3
