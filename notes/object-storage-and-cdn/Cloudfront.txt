Exam Tips
  - SEE Critical Terms - Edge Location, Origin, and Distribution
  - Edge locations are not for READ only, you can write them too. That object will then be replicated to the origin server.
  - Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time To Live)
  - You can clear cached objects, but will be charged.

Critical Terms
  - CDN: a content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that delivers web pages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.
  - Edge Location: this is the location where content will be cached. This is separate to an AWS Region/AZ.
  - Origin: This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can be either an S3 Bucket, an EC2 instance, an Elastic Load Balancer or Route 53.
  - Distribution: This is the name given to the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations.
    - Web Distribution (CDN) - typically used for websites
    - RTMP (CDN) - used for media streaming
