What is Snowball?
- Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS.

Snowball Notes
- Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns.
- Transferring data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed internet.
- 80 TB Snowball in all regions.
- Snowball uses multiple layers of security designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant enclosures, 256-bit encryption, and industry-standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both security and full chain-of-custody of your data.
- Once the data transfer job has been processed and verified, AWS performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.

What is Snowball Edge?
- Pretty much a Snowball, BUT...

Snowball Edge Notes
- It provides storage capacity AND compute capacity (via Lambda functions).
- 100 TB data transfer device with on-board storage and compute capabilities.
- You can use Snowball Edge to move large amounts of data into and out of AWS, as a temporary storage tier for large local datasets, or to support local workloads in remote or offline locations.
- Snowball Edge connects to your existing applications and infrastructure using standard storage interfaces, streamlining the data transfer process and minimizing setup and integration.
- Snowball Edge can cluster together to form a local storage tier and process your data on-premises, helping ensure your applications continue to run even when they are not able to access the cloud.

What is Snowmobile?
- Pretty much a Snowball, but it's fucking truck!

Snowmobile Notes
- Petabyte (PB) to Exabyte (EB) levels of data.
- AWS Snowmobile is an Exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move extremely large amounts of data to AWS.
- You can transfer up to 100 PB per Snowmobile.
- Snowmobile is a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi-trailer truck.
- Snowmobile makes it easy to move massive volumes of data to the cloud, including video libraries, image repositories, or even a complete data center migration. Transferring data with Snowmobile is secure, fast, and cost-effective.

BEFORE Snowball, there was AWS Import/Export Disk
- An AWS Import/Export Disk accelerates moving large amounts of data into and out of the AWS cloud using portable storage devices for transport.
- AWS Import/Export Disk transfers your data directly onto and off storage devices using Amazon's high-speed internal network and bypassing the internet.
