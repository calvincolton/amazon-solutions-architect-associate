Notes
- A security group is a virtual firewall that controls access to your EC2 instances.
- When applying or changing rules of a security group, changes are instantaneous.
- Security Groups are stateful (when adding inbound rules, outbound rules are added automatically)
- You can not add rules that block traffic, only add rules that enable inbound traffic.
- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
- All outbound traffic is allowed by default
- Changes to security groups take effect immediately
- You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group
- You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instances
- Security groups are STATEFUL
  - If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again
- You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use Network Access Control Lists
- You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules
