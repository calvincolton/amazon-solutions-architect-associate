Two types of Placement Groups:
- Clustered Placement Group
  - A grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone.
  - Placement Groups are recommended for applications that need low network latency, high network throughput, or both.
  - Only certain instances can be launched in to a Clustered Placement Group.
  - Can NOT span multiple Availability Zones
  Note: When you see placement group called out in the exam, it is a Clustered Placement Group
- Spread Placement Group
  - A group of instances that are each placed on distinct underlying hardware.
  - Spread Placement Groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other.
  - Can span multiple Availability Zones
