Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a file storage service for EC2 instances.

- EFS is easy to use and provides a simple interface that allows you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily.
- With EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it.
- Supports the Network File System Version 4 (NFSv4) protocol
- You only pay for the storage you use (no pre-provisioning required)
- Can scale up to the petabytes
- Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- Data is stored across multiple Availability Zones within a region
- Block-based storage

EBS vs EFS?
- EFS allows multiple EC2 instances to be connected to it
