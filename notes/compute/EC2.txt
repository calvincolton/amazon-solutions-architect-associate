What is EC2?
- Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.
- i.e. a virtual machine

Notes
- EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use
- Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate them from common failure scenarios

Pricing Options
- On Demand
  - Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or second) with no commitment
  - Perfect for users that want the low cost and flexibility of EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
  - Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
- Reserved
  - Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offers a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance (1 to 3 year terms)
  - Useful for applications with steady state or predictable usage
  - Applications that require reserved capacity
  - Users can make up-front payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
  - Standard RIs (up to 75% off on-demand)
  - Convertable RIs (up to 54% off on-demand)
    - Feature the capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value
  - Scheduled RIs
    - Available to launch within the time window you reserve.
    - This option allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, week, or month
- Spot
  - Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times
  - Applications that have flexible start and end times
  - Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
  - Users with an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity.
- Dedicated Hosts: physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses
  - Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
  - Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
  - Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly)
  - Can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price.

Post-lab Exam Tips
- Termination Protection is turned off by default, you must turn it on
- On an EBS-backed instance, the default action is the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
- EBS root volumes of your default AMI's cannot be encrypted.
  - You can also use a third party tool (such as bit locker, etc) to encrypt the root volume, or this can be done when creating AMIs in the AWS console or using the API
  - Additional volumes can be encrypted
