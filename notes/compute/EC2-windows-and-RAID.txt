RAID = Redundant Array of Independent Disks
  - RAID 0 (common in gaming)
    - Striped, no redundancy, good performance
  - RAID 1
    - Mirrored, redundancy
  - RAID 5
    - Good for reads, bad for writes
    - AWS does not recommend ever putting RAID 5's on EBS
  - RAID 10
    - Striped, and mirrored, good redundancy, good performance
    - A combination of RAID 1 and RAID 0
- To take a snapshot of a RAID array
  1) Freeze the file system
  2) Unmount the RAID array
  3) Shutting down the associated EC2 instance
