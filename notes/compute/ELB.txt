What is a load balancer?
- A virtual machine that balances the load of your web application (http/https traffic) across web servers.

3 Types of Load Balancers
- Application Load Balancer
  - Best suited for load balancing HTTP and HTTPS traffic
  - Operate at Layer 7 (application layer) and are application-aware
  - Intelligent and you can create advanced request routing, sending specified requests to specific web servers
- Network Load Balancer
  - Best suited for load balancing TCP traffic where extreme performance is required
  - Operating at the Layer 4 (connection layer), these are capable of handling millions of requests per second, while maintaining ultra-low latencies
  - Use for extreme performance!
- Classic Load Balancer
  - Legacy Elastic Load Balancer
  - You can load balance HTTP/HTTPS applications and use Layer 7-specific features such as X-forwarded-for and sticky sessions
  - You can also use Layer 4 load balancing for applications that rely purely on the TCP protocol

Load Balancer Errors
- 504: Gateway has timed out. Your application stops responding. This can be at the Web Server layer or the Database layer

X-Forwared-For header
  - this passes on the public IP address to your EC2 instance

Exam Tips
  - Remember the 3 types of load balancers, and that the classic load balancer is the legacy load balancer
  - Instances monitored by ELB are reported as:
    - InService
    - OutofService
  - Health Checks check the instance health by talking to it
  - Have their own DNS name, you are never given an IP address
  - Read the ELB FAQ for Classic Load Balancers
