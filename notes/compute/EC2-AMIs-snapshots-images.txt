AMI - Amazon Machine Image
- To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
- You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted
  - These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public
- All AMIs are categorized as either backed by Amazon EBS or backed by Instance Store
- For EBS Volumes, the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot
- For Instance Store Volumes, the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3

EBS vs Instance Store
- You can select your AMI based:
  - Region
  - OS
  - Architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
  - Launch Permissions
  - Storage for the Root Device
    - Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage, i.e. less durability)
    - EBS backed volumes
- You cannot stop Instance Stores as you can EBS instances

Exam Tips
- Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage
- Instance Store Volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data
- EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped
- You can reboot both, you will not lose your data
- By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination, however with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume
